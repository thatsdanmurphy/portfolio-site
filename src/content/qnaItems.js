    question: "How do you approach messy problems?",
    answer:
      "I break the situation down piece by piece. I ask what success looks like? Or what would it look like if we failed? What activities get us there? I learned this at Accenture scoping proposals and brought it to Motional, where we built a clean operating environment for an untested future."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you re-light a team that’s gone dim?",
    answer:
      "Get people talking in a way others want to hear. I surface the work, show why it matters, and create space to share and learn. The energy shift happens stitch by stitch, that's how you repair the fabric of a team."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s a feature you regret shipping?",
    answer:
      "Auto opt-in for driverless delivery. Some people were thrilled. Others were confused, even frustrated. It created drop-offs and missed handoffs. We worked to fix the awareness gap, but it taught me what happens when business goals run ahead of human ones."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s something you’d fix, even if no one asked you to?",
    answer:
      "Naming and file organization. It sounds small, but it shapes how teams work, think, and hand off. A clean system frees up energy for the work that actually matters."
  },
  {
    question: "What’s a tension you protect in your work?",
    answer:
      "I try to make sure fast doesn’t mean robotic. A product can move quickly and still feel human. Tone matters more than most realize."
  },
  {
    question: "Are you even good?",
    answer:
      "I am. But I don’t shout about it. I stay curious, I show up, and I try to make the work and the people around me better."
